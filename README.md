## Frontend Architecture

The frontend code is structured as follows:

```
src/
 ├── components/       # Reusable components
 ├── context/          # Authentication context management
 ├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
 ├── pages/            # Main pages
 ├── utils/            # Utility functions
 ├── main.jsx          # Application entry point
 ├── App.jsx           # Routes configuration
```

## Authentication and User Management

Authentication is managed using `JWT`, with tokens stored in `localStorage`. The `AuthContext` allows user information to be accessed throughout the application.

### Relevant files:
- `/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` → Global user management.
- `/src/hooks/useLogin.js` → Login handling.
- `/src/hooks/useLogout.js` → Logout handling.

## Routes and Navigation

Navigation is managed using `react-router-dom` in `App.jsx`.

| Route               | Rendered Component           |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| `/`               | HomePage                    |
| `/login`          | LoginPage                   |
| `/register`       | RegisterPage                |
| `/profile/consumer` | ConsumerProfilePage         |
| `/profile/winery` | WineryProfilePage           |
| `*`               | Not Found Page              |
